        'body': "Today we worked with pyramid and that was a really interesting thing to see. I feel like with pyramid it's a lot to get at once, so I'm not really sure that I know exactly what Ely and I did today in pair programming. We both got our sites up and deployed to heroku, but I'm not sure what happened in between those two steps, but I know something did. I reviewed over the jinja2 for class tomorrow and that looks like it ought to be fun. We also talked about some project ideas for the upcoming midterm week and that was a lot of fun. We definitely had a good mix of ideas to choose from, so it's going to be hard to make a list tonight. I don't have much in my learning journals html, but I'm going to try to work on that tonight. Everyone said week 2 was the most intense, but personally I feel like it's going to be week 3. Today was a good day."

        'body': "Today we did our first whiteboard data structure assignment and that was pretty cool. We worked on a reverse linked list for that assignment which was similar to our single linked list, but backwards. After that we had a talk from 3 previous students and that was really nice to see what life after code fellows can be like. There was a partner power hour and then we all dove back in to working on our server assignments and our data structures. We got our data structure finished on Friday, but Casey and I have some more to do on our servers assignment. I'm not 100% sure we're going to complete this assignment completely, but I think that's going to be okay. From talking to other students and some previous students, I get the vibe that some projects are going to be more of the do what you can and to the best of your ability, but you'll just have to turn them in not completely done and that's okay. Today was a good day."

        'body': "We got our queue data structure today which looks at first glance very similar to the stack data structure from a few days back. This week has been interesting as far as getting into the groove of having two partners projects for the first time. At the beginning of the week the server project felt like it was a little easier and data structures we were behind on, but now that it is the end of the week it has flipped flopped. Kurt and I have gotten our data structure up to speed, but not Casey and I are a little behind on the server. To me it's interesting to see that change. I felt like data structures would never get caught up and that eventually the server project too would be behind just as we added more throughout the week, so it's a good experience to see that flip and then work through it. I feel like as we near the end of week 2 things are hard, but it's not too bad. I've had a lot of people from other 401's say to me, 'I heard Python was insanely hard!' and I think Python is hard, but I don't think it's anymore hard than the iOS or the Javascript 401. I think if you keep the right mindset through out you'll be fine. It's super easy to look at everyone else and go, well I'm way behind everyone else, I should quit! But, I think to some degree everyone at one point or another is lost in this course. So, I'm trying every day to remind myself to think positively and to not compare myself to anyone else in the class. I am me, and where I am on this journey (I started coding 4 months ago) is not where everyone else will be, and that's okay. I can be happy for someone else's accomplishments all while respecting my own. My mom used to always say, 'You're Anna - not (Insert name). It's great (insert name) can do this, but you're not there yet. So, be kind with yourself and learn from anyone that you can and you'll get there.' I think if we can all remember to do that - it'll be a better experience. Today was a good day."
